This library was conceived as an experiment for me. I do not expect it to gain much popularity and I do not even think that it will be able to compete with serde and serde_json.

For me, all this is just learning and a desire to make my own, albeit minimal, contribution to the open source Rust community.

But still I believe that this project will be useful to you and you will use it in your code
